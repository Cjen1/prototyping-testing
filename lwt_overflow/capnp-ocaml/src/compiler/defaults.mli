(* Management of default values for structs and lists.  These values are
   passed as a pointers to data stored in the PluginSchema message
   generated by capnpc.  We will need to make a deep copy to transfer these
   objects into a StringStorage-based message, so we can easily serialize
   the string contents right into the generated code. *)

(** [gen_builder_defaults defaults] generates code which does the following:
    1) Builds a string literal containing the message content
    2) Instantiates a message object from the contents of the string literal
    3) Instantiates struct and list descriptors which refer to the default
       values stored within that message object, which are suitable for
       use within the Builder implementation

    The generated code is returned as a list of lines. *)

(** [gen_reader_defaults defaults] generates code which does the following:
    1) Instantiates a new message object of a type matching the functor parameter
    2) Deep copies the builder defaults into the new message
    3) Instantiates struct and list descriptors which refer to the default
       values stored within the new message object, which are suitable for
       use within the Reader implementation
